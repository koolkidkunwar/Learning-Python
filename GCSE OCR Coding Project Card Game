#This is Task 2
#Katarina is developing a two-player dice game.
#The players roll two 6-sided dice each and get points depending on what they
#roll. There are 5 rounds in a game. In each round, each player rolls the two dice.
#The rules are:
#• The points rolled on each player’s dice are added to their score.
#• If the total is an even number, an additional 10 points are added to their score.
#• If the total is an odd number, 5 points are subtracted from their score.
#• If they roll a double, they get to roll one extra die and get the number of points #rolled added to
#their score.
#• The score of a player cannot go below 0 at any point.
#• The person with the highest score at the end of the 5 rounds wins.
#• If both players have the same score at the end of the 5 rounds, they each roll 1 die and
#whoever gets the highest score wins (this repeats until someone wins).
#Only authorised players are allowed to play the game.
#Where appropriate, input from the user should be validated.
#Design, develop, test and evaluate a program that:
#1. Allows two players to enter their details, which are then authenticated to ensure that #they are
#authorised players.
#2. Allows each player to roll two 6-sided dice.
#3. Calculates and outputs the points for each round and each player’s total score.
#4. Allows the players to play 5 rounds.
#5. If both players have the same score after 5 rounds, allows each player to roll 1 die #each until
#someone wins.
#6. Outputs who has won at the end of the 5 rounds.
#7. Stores the winner’s score, and their name, in an external file.
#8. Displays the score and player name of the top 5 winning scores from the external file.
